MissionControl
==============

This kids' homework desk has top that flips up to reveal a space-themed control panel. 

This code is provided as an example only. It is not intended to be installed and run as-is. Unless you have the exact hardware and wiring, it won't work. Feel free to use bits of it to teach yourself the necessary functions, but experiment on a per-function basis until you understand each part well enough to put it all together. I am not a professional programmer and only just barely got this working, so my ability to help you with problems is severely limited. I recommend the most excellent book, "Getting Started with Raspberry Pi," available at: http://www.makershed.com/Getting_Started_with_Raspberry_Pi_p/9781449344214-p.htm  If you are still having trouble, try posting your questions to www.stackexchange.com

You can find your own sounds to use at www.freesound.org and the Apollo 11 flight journal: http://history.nasa.gov/ap11fj/

Have fun building your own adventure!
